This Topic is About the Challenges possesed by medical and healthcare domain and how we can solve them with the help
machine learning. Machine learning can transform this Domain in the following manner.It can Help us Deliver precise 
amount of medication at patients level. Also can help us understand the ups and downs of health and diseases.Reduce
cost, transform the health of population and lead to many new discoveries.

Now Talking about time series analysis in healthcare domain. It can be used to do the forecasting for survival of a
patient.The possible effect of a treatment in future could be known using TS forecasting.Clustering of patients 
based on their health condition and diseases.

The diseases have been evolving over time and the data is sparse and irregular.The problem faced also are that the 
origin of the disease and the time at which the disease took over the body is not known.

The Aim is to build a disease progression model using time series data, weather it is from electronic record data 
or disease regestries or other longitudional data.Train the model on the model parameters from available data and do
dynamic forecastingfor patient and understand hoew disease progress.

Current disease progression model uses Marcov Model. Disadvantages of such models is that it assumes we can observe 
every stage of the disease which is not the case and also it only works for 1 disease at a time. Another disadvantage 
is that it is modelling Avg patient which is not personalized to the unique character of the patient.

One particular advancement is to model the diseases using Hidden marcov model. in HMM all the different states that 
a patient can pass through is observable.
